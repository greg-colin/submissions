===============================

Double-click on index.html to start the game. Instructions for gameplay are displayed
immediately to the left of the game and are repeated here:

Instructions
The objective is to move to the top of the screen in an upward direction.
You must collect all of the jewels (if any) on each level to be allowed
to the next level. Jewels may be atop one another for multiple, simultaneous prizes.
The player cannot move off offscreen to left, right, or downward.

Keys Supported:
Cursor Up, Down, Left, Right - Move player
a - audio toggle background music
b - bounding rectangles show (freezes play)
c - change character

Notes:
The game sounds best in Chrome - something about the handling of the HTML5 audio
element, I think. IE users are out of luck entirely.

The page is styled to match with my not-yet-online portfolio website, as are
the JSDoc-generated pages though to a lesser degree as some styles are evidently
superceded by others in the JSoc templates. I did spend some time on that, but
it wasn't central to the assignment.
